# Phone-Number-Simulator

This program is a simple phone number simulator that allows the user to add, search (by name and number), remove, sort, and display contacts. Each contact has a name and a phone number attached to it. Each phone number added to the program must be at least 10 digits. The program runs in a loop that allows users to choose different options until they decide to quit.
